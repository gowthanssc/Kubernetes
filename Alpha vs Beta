Alpha level:

The version names contain alpha (e.g. v1alpha1).
May be buggy. Enabling the feature may expose bugs. Disabled by default.
Support for feature may be dropped at any time without notice.
The API may change in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice.
Recommended for use only in short-lived testing clusters, due to increased risk of bugs and lack of long-term support.


Beta level:

The version names contain beta (e.g. v2beta3).
Code is well tested. Enabling the feature is considered safe. Enabled by default.
Support for the overall feature will not be dropped, though details may change.
The schema and/or semantics of objects may change in incompatible ways in a subsequent beta or stable release.
When this happens, we will provide instructions for migrating to the next version. This may require deleting, editing, and re-creating API objects.
The editing process may require some thought.
This may require downtime for applications that rely on the feature.
Recommended for only non-business-critical uses because of potential for incompatible changes in subsequent releases. 
If you have multiple clusters which can be upgraded independently, you may be able to relax this restriction.
Please do try our beta features and give feedback on them! Once they exit beta, it may not be practical for us to make more changes.


Stable level:
The version name is vX where X is an integer.
Stable versions of features will appear in released software for many subsequent versions.
